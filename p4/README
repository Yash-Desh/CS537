1. Round Robin Scheduler gives all the processes that enter at the same time equal opportunity to run
Hence we see that irrespective of the number of tickets each process is assigned, they all have the same 
runtime.

2. On the otherhand, stride scheduler prioritizes fairness measured in terms of number of tickets assigned 
to the process.

It prioritizes processes with more tickets, leading to a fairer distribution and predictable runtimes.

3. Advantage of stride scheduling is deterministic runtimes prioritizing fairness in terms of assigned tickets

Considering the last entry in stride_process_stats.csv
1. ignoring the 1st 5 processes
2. processes with tickets=32 that entered at the beginning have a runtime of 816
3. process with tickets=16 that entered at the beginning has a runtime of 409 which is roughly half
4. process with tickets=8 that entered at the beginning has a runtime of 205 which is roughly half
5. process with tickets=4 that entered at the beginning has a runtime of 103 which is roughly half
6. process with tickets=2 that entered at the beginning has a runtime of 52 which is roughly half

while the same entries in rr__process_stats.csv have a runtime of 4122 which is the same for all processes
